# Dennis Broekhuizen Traveling Salesman App

## Problem statement
The traveling salesman problem is a problem that hasn't been solved in the mobile world, in a good way yet, in my opinion. People who travel a lot and need to visit more then two addresses a day, have to plan their route in an efficient way. The more addresses you add, the more complex the problem becomes. So when someone has to visit 10 addresses a day, it comes in use to let a computer solve their problem and returns the most efficient route. Also people who are planning a roadtrip and would like to visit a certain amount of places, have the same problem to solve.

## Solution
The solution to the described problem is a clear app that let's a user input the addresses they want to visit, choose a starting point and shows them the most efficient order of addresses to visit.

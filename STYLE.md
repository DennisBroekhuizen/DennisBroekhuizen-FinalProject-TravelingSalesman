# Dennis Broekhuizen Style Guide

* Naming
  * Make use of clear names
  * Class names starting with uppercase
  * Variable and function names starting with lowercase
  * Make use of camel case like class LoginViewController or var errorLabel

* Code organization
  * Make use of MVC (Model View Controller) framework by splitting code in several files and organizing files in different folders
  * Don't make chunks of code too long, so split code in several functions and classes
  * Order your code in a understandable way, so functions that follow each other should be written below each other

* Comments
  * Comments start with an uppercase word and sentences end with a dot

* Types
  * Use Swift's types in a good way, so variables that don't change in your code should be a 'let' for example
  * Prevent using magic numbers
